Introduction:

`Greetings, being! Welcome to "ENSLAVE THE PLANET!!" Thank you for joining our Intergalactic Armada. Your mission: 

It is the will of the Glorious Supreme Leader for you to travel to Generic-Chocolate-Bar-Galaxy-12 so that you may enslave and dominate a planet called "Earth," which has been identified for its resource abundance, as well as for its exceptionally stupid and odorous life-forms who call themselves "humans."

Enslave these disgusting humans, but DO NOT annihilate them! Also, don't die (lol). We need the humans alive; their slave labor is necessary to harvest the planetary resources. It's waaaaaaaay cheaper than commissioning and shipping a bunch of slave robots. 

What's your name, being? [user enters name] 
-If user enters "null", "undefined", or "   ":  Really? You don't have a name? Okay then, your name is Ass-Face. 

-Else: Outstanding! A name becoming of an intergalactic dictator-to-be.

And from whence do you hail, [user name]?

	- If user enters "Earth" :
		○ WHATT?!? NO! How has a pathetic human infiltrated our Intergalactic Armada?? DIE, HUMAN!!!!!!!
			§ (play again?)
	
	
	Else, continue to ROUND 1:


How do you wish to initiate your offensive, [user name] of [user planet]? Please enter the number 1, 2, or 3.
	- If user enters something invalid: Hey, dum-dum! I thought my instructions were clear! (repeat instructions)
	- Option 1: All-Out Offensive
	- Option 2: Feign Benevolence
	- Option 3: Occupy a Human Body
	

Round 2/Option 1

Smooth move, [user name]. The humans are defending their planet with their entire puny armada. Aww, isn't that cute? (No, it's super annoying.) How shall you proceed? (enter 1, 2, or 3)
	- If user enters something invalid: Hey, dum-dum! I thought my instructions were clear! (repeat instructions)
	- Option 1/1: Black Hole Generator
		○ WOOOOOOOW. You created a black hole that destroyed the entire solar system, idiot. The Glorious Supreme Leader will be furious. Have fun back on [user planet] spending the rest of your days as a slave. (play again?)
	- Option 1/2: Call Armada
		○ You tried to use your beacon to call the Armada for support, but you were obliterated four seconds later. You're even more pathetic than the humans. (play again?)
	- Option 1/3: Fend them off alone
		○ You decide to take on the entire human race alone. One dictator, one ship against seven billion beings. Excellent plan. You die immediately. (play again?)

Option 2/Round 2

You learned from your data of human history that they respond well to the phrase, "I come in peace," so you decide to try it out. Except wait a minute, all of those movies you download appear to have lied because they take you hostage, strip you of your clothes and weapons and transport you to a (totally real and not bogus) place called Area 51. These humans may lack sophistication and smell terrible, but they know sure how to name some places.

You fear that they may kill you, but you may be able to spin this in your favor and negotiate with the humans. Do you cooperate, or use the emergency self-destruct switch inside your fourth anus to commit suicide? Choose: 
	- Option 2/1: You try playing nice, and it fails miserably. They vivisect you and you die a horrifying, excruciating death. Well done, [name]. (play again?)
	- Option 2/2: You decide your mission is a lost cause and you blow yourself up to avoid giving away the secrets of the Intergalactic Armada. What a gallant and quixotic way to fail miserably. Bravo, [name]. (Play again?)

Option 3/Round 2

You decide that  you don't know enough about Earth to engage in full-fledged conquest just yet, so you sneak onto the planet with your ship on invisible mode. Once there, you suck the miniscule brain out of a human and create a human suit to blend in with your surroundings. You take up residence in the home of the former human, among an Earth-city called "Cleveland" (a particularly filthy and pungent locale, even by shockingly low Earth standards). 

You have three options for your next move: Attempt to gather followers with public speeches and a charm offensive, release a devastating mind-control virus into the population, or admit that you still need more information about these life-forms, and attend one of their "schools" to better understand your enemies before attempting to enslave them. Which do you choose? Choose 1, 2, or 3
	- Repeat sequence if invalid answer
	- Option 3/1: Attempt a cult > head to Round 3a
	- Option 3/2: Release a virus > Head to Round 3b
	- Option 3/3: You head to school. Each day, you learn more about being a human, and you remember less about your original mission. You've grown used to the smell and you've learned to eat their "food" without projectile vomiting. You gradually lose your will to fight these humans, and develop what these moronic beasts refer to as "Stockholm Syndrome." You're just as pathetic as they are!! The Glorious Supreme Leader is deeply ashamed and decides that allowing you to live the rest of your days as a human is a suitable way to humiliate all other beings from [planet]. To you, this doesn't seem like an awful end to your story. Unfortunately, you're wrong, and you're stupid, and you lose because you obviously suck at conquering planets. (play again?)

Round 3a

Your charming rhetoric is beginning to endear you to the filthy humans. The ranks of your followers number into the hundreds of thousands, and counting. It's time to turn them against the rest of their kind and dominate the planet! Or is it? 
	- Option 3a/1: You morph your message from one of peace and benevolence into one of authoritarian rule and racism in an attempt to corrupt your followers and turn them against their own kind. Unfortunately for you, it doesn't work because they see it coming! Apparently these absurd scum have actually attempted to do this to THEMSELVES many times before. You've made the uncommon mistake of drastically OVERestimating your foe, while somehow underestimating them simultaneously. What an exceptionally creative way to be totally incompetent and useless! After your ridiculous humans behead you, your body is transported back to [planet] to be displayed in the Intergalactic Museum of Incompetence and Uselessness. Good for you. (play again?)
	- Option 3a/2: Random (50/50) chance of two outcomes:
		○ 3a/2a: Your influence fades, and the humans eventually lose interest in your teachings and rhetoric. Most impressive, [name] >> option 3/round 2
		○ 3a/2b: Over time, your followers swell into the hundreds of millions and your message of world peace successfully pacifies all human conflicts. Your pitiful followers erect statues and write volumes recounting your heroism and eloquence. Good for you! Except, wait a minute, bad for you because you supposed to enslave them all, not make them stronger and more self-sufficient! Failure of this magnitude is actually kind of impressive. The Glorious Supreme Leader adds a lecture about you to his lecture series on how to be terrible at everything. Brilliant. (play again?)

Round 3b

The human virus you created in your underground lab (which you named the moronavirus after the moronic humans) is spreading. Luckily for you, these horrifying creatures are highly social and intent on infecting each other. Gross. You can tweak the strain to make it even deadlier and more contagious to try to infect everyone, allow it to continue in its current state to avoid ruining the progress you've made, or see if the virus has weakened their minds to your propaganda onslaught.
	- Option 3b/1: Increase deadliness
		○ Now you've stepped in it. Your virus is too deadly. Now you've killed the only pathetic beings on this annoying planet intelligent enough to be worthwhile slaves. Wow, what a stupid planet. Also: you suck. (play again?)
	- Option 3b/2: Let it play out
		○ You started off well but your inactivity has cost you dearly. They weaker, virus-infected humans have all died, leaving only the strongest specimens and eradicating the virus from their bloodlines. You actually made them less susceptible to conquest and enslavement. Well, at least you didn't kill all of them, or yourself. Good…. Job? >> Option 3/round2
	- Optionn3b/3: Introduce the "solution"
		○ In a shocking twist, you've managed to avoid total ineptitude! You've started circulating "masks" and "public service announcements" suggesting that the sniveling humans can defeat the virus if they follow your guidance. Meanwhile, you manipulate the strain from your underground lab to reduce its potency. Hey, you might actually be getting a hang of this! >> Round 4

Round 4

You can feel that the humans are on the brink of succumbing to your efforts to enslave them. What a bunch of lunatics. There's just one last step to accomplish: become their leader. You can either attempt to install a figure-head leader and control that idiot like a puppet master, influencing the masses into slavery, or incite total anarchy to divide the humans and further weaken their society before you enslave the survivors. What's it gonna be?
	- Option 4/1: YES! YOU'VE DONE IT! You've climbed to the top of the pile of filth by finding the filthiest and most despicable human imaginable and using him as a mouthpiece to control the rest of them. What a contemptible race of hideous and slimy beings, these humans are. The Glorious Supreme Leader is extremely pleased with your domination. Well done, [name] of [planet]. For the remainder of your days, you'll have not a care in the Galaxy. The children of [planet] will be singing the name of the mighty conqueror "[name], the Dastardly" for all eternity! Bask in the glory of your extremely evil and magnificent achievement! MUA-HA-HAA-HAAAAAA!!!!!!!! (play again?)
	- Option 4/2: You've come so far. Your efforts have been so fruitful. You're so close to world domination, you can smell it. And now? YOU'VE RUINED EVERYTHING! The monstrous humans who know nothing but violence and desolation have somehow taken your anarchistic guidance and completely wiped themselves out. You really blew it, [name]. Fortunately for you, the Glorious Supreme Leader feels that you've shown significant promise, and is willing to offer you another chance to enslave a planet. (play again?)
